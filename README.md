- Aggregations (SUM)
- GROUP BY and ORDER BY
- Business-driven filtering using WHERE clause
- Table aliases for readability

## Files Included
- joins_queries.sql – All working SQL queries with comments
- joined_output.csv – Sample output structure from JOIN queries
- insights.txt – 3 business insights derived from analysis

## Note
